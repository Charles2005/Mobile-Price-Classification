## Project Description
- Predicting the price range of a mobile phone/Smartphone using its specification like: Ram, cores, storage, etc.
- The whole analysis and visualization are made through pandas and matplotlib library.
- The data that is used in this project is available at Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification).
- Through the analysis mobile's ram is a great factor of a mobile's price. 
- Mobile's camera affects the other specification like ram and cores. The higher the pixel of a camera the lower the value of other specification. 
- The size of the mobile also affect the price of a mobile phone/smartphone.
